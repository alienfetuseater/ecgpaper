typescript type errors fail silently. case example, changing width by form was submitting a string value for a number, where util.complexwidth was requiring a Number, but getting a string from user input, and result was a type coercion of strings and instead of '22' we got '413158'. so when defining functions we need to for this reason do error handling even when we dont think its necessary. try catch block would have caught this error perhaps.
